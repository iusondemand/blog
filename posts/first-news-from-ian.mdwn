First News from Ian {.page-header}
===================

Hi everyone! I'm very pleased to share with you the first blog commit
from Ian McGowan, who joined our forces last month thanks to your
donations! I have been working with Ian to explain the difficult task of
curating points on the forum, analysing the topics, and leading the
discussions that ultimately enable us to make the reviews that you see
on tosdr.org. So without further introduction, here's a small update
from Ian.\

As of 30 Nov 2012, we have added many points about a number of the
services being reviewed on the site. This includes points about
Facebook, Wikipedia, Amazon, Wordpress, Dropbox, and WhatsApp. Although
none of these services have terms that have been reviewed in their
entirety at this point, we have made great strides in pulling out the
main points thus far. It has been my goal to phrase the information in
language that is as easy to understand as possible. We have some
contributors, but continue to welcome more!
