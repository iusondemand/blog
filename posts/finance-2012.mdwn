    i found the missing 50 euros. :) let me know if you find any errors in the
    attached calculation.

    on top of this we will spend about 200 EUR for 500 ToS;DR-logo stickers
    from StickerMule, 3"x1" with rounded corners plus 300:

    (v) No, i *Didn't Read* your *Terms of Service* - *ToS;DR*
    *
    *
    stickers, 10"x1" with i guess rounded corners as well,

    and then about 800 EUR for about 100 T-shirts from CafePress, and about 300
    EUR for all the shipping, so that's about 200+800+300 = 1300 EUR on the
    perks, so then our current balance is just under 17 kEUR.

    shipping from Hacker Beach should be doable, but shipping /to/ Hacker Beach
    is going to be tricky. If we want to avoid relying on the communist post
    office then we may have to travel to the nearest UPS/Fedex office to pick
    stuff up, which is probably in Saigon...
