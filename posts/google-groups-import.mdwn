================================================

This is just a quick update to let you know that I'm working on
importing all the posts from the Google Groups forum into our database.

The goal is to have a user interface right here on tosdr.org, where all
participants can submit their data points directly into the database, so
we can review them much more efficiently than when we have to copy each
forum thread into the database manually, as we have been doing up till
now.

The review process will not change, we will still discuss all review
points before we publish them on the site, but it will become more
efficient.

For now, everybody can just keep on sending review points to the Google
Groups forum as described on our [Get
Involved](http://tosdr.org/get-involved.html) page, but the long-term
goal is to remove that step from our process. More news soon!
