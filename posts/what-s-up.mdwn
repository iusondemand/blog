What's up? {.page-header}
==========

It's been a while since we've informed you all what's happening around
here at ToS;DR, which is a shame because there's lots to talk about!

As far as curating more and more new data points goes, well, we've taken
a slight break from that (but don't worry, I'm getting right back on
that!) to take a hard look at the points we already had. This was a case
of "quality over quantity", where we felt we'd rather have top quality
data points for our visitors to see rather than a large amount of shoddy
work. Now that we've done that and taken some time to review what we've
already collected, it's back to gather new points for new and old
services alike.

There's also some great news on the "business" end, that being that we
are in the process of becoming a not-for-profit legal entity. This will
allow us to take on more projects and apply for grant money outside of
running simply on your donations (which we're very grateful for, by the
way!). More on that later.

We also have t-shirts and stickers that have been ordered for those of
you who contributed to this project financially, as our way of saying
thank you. Hopefully those will be getting out to you soon!

Apologies on the delayed blog entry, but keep checking back to see what
all is going on behind the scenes here at ToS;DR.
