Hello World! (again) {.page-header}
====================

An update of the project is overdue. Since we started working on this in
June, much has happened which we did not anticipate. Feedback on the
project has been excellent, and participation from the community has
extended beyond our hopes.

In September, Jan went back from his vacation in north-America, Michiel
spent much time on the next version of "Unhosted" and other new awesome
ideas; while I went back to university to pursue my law studies. We've
run a [successful crowdfunding
campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/terms-of-service-didnt-read?c=pledges),
which allows us to envision the next steps to make the project
sustainable and to really make an impact!

We first have to thank every one of you again who contributed to
bootstrap this project! You'll definitely hear more from us in the next
few days. We'll publish here the web logs of our work, among articles
etc. As usual, you can follow us [on twitter](http://twitter.com/tosdr)
and also now from [the projects' blog](index.html) ([subscribe to the
feed](feed.rss)).

Stay tuned!
