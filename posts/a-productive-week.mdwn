A productive week {.page-header}
=================

This last week or so has been quite the productive one, with lots of
great contributions. We've made preliminary data points for the
following services that will be appearing on the website in the near
future:

-   SpiderOak
-   Reddit
-   IFTTT
-   Allrecipes
-   Apple
-   Fara
-   Envato
-   Nokia
-   CouchSurfing
-   Indiegogo
-   Skype Education
-   Grammarly

The data points gathered are by no means complete at this point for all
of these services, but we've made great progress. One of the dilemmas
we've encountered is how to frame Terms that cover more than one service
(e.g., Envato), but we welcome discussion and contributions on that
topic!!! Thanks for reading, and as another bit of information, we do
have [an extension for Google
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terms-of-service-didn%E2%80%99t-r/hjdoplcnndgiblooccencgcggcoihigg/).
Check it out!"
