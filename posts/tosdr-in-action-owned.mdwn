[This post is part of a series in collaboration with the BBC Radio 4
“Law in Action,” where we try to debunk some of the myths related to
terms of service and privacy policies. [Read episode

This week, we're focusing on another big topic related to terms of
service: what's happening to content (e.g. pictures, videos) you upload
to a service?

Services usually mention that they're not going to sell your content or
that “what's yours stays yours.” Yet, you'd better be careful: there are
still many things they could do…

A (very) basic introduction to copyright and author's rights
------------------------------------------------------------

The basic principle is that once a person has created or invested in a
work, usually with a minimum of creativity, this person is automatically
considered the “author” or the copyright holder of that published work.
There are differences around the world, but we can say it's a basic
principle under the Berne convention, an international agreement that
governs copyright and author's rights laws worldwide.

Such laws bear various justifications: allowing to reward creators for
their work and incentivise their production; organising exclusive rights
to enable return-on-investments; enhancing creativity to bring benefits
to society at large.

If, nowadays, copyright has been discussed at great lengths in politics
and the media as a burning issue concerning non-authorised distribution
of music and films on the Internet, another significant side of
copyright has been mainly overlooked: what's happening to **your**
copyright, the rights on your photos, your videos, etc.

How services exploit your copyright
-----------------------------------

Today, incredibly vast amounts of copyrighted works are published by
users on the Web (in the so-called Web 2.0 era of “User Generated
Content”) through publication services such as Twitter, Facebook,
YouTube, Instagram, and etc. However, very little has been said about
what happens to users' copyrights. The sad truth is written plainly in
the Terms: a lot of services are claiming over-broad rights on users'
content – while they have absolutely not contributed to its creation!

-   True, with these services, “you retain your rights” to your content.
    They do not ask for a transfer of copyright ownership, but they
    mainly ask you to grant them **broad**, sometimes
    **almost-unlimited**, licenses to your content.
-   True, these services do not “sell” your content. What they do is
    *transfer* the license you grant them, or they grant *sublicenses*
    themselves to third-parties. That means they can give rights on your
    content to other businesses, without asking you.
-   True, users have “agreed” to that. But we know that the current
    agreement to terms of service is
    [meaningless](http://tosdr.org/blog/tosdr-in-action-i-have-read-and-agree.html),
    and moreover, for many services (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
    Twitpic, and etc.), the current copyright license was created when
    the terms were changed.

[Twitter](http://tosdr.org/#twitter) can change the terms at any time
when they see fit; they can choose to give notification, in their sole
discretion, via an @Twitter update or via email. In September 2009,
Twitter considerably changed the terms for the copyright license and
only gave a very short notice a few hours before the changes applied.
Furthermore, if you actually try to go read that email and the blog post
it links to, you will notice that Twitter omits to mention the biggest
changes to their copyright license. [See our discussion: [on the
mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/-B4iO-9xHvg/0yoWGoEISrEJ)]

[Twitpic](http://tosdr.org/#twitpic) has been able to exploit the rights
users have granted them, probably without most users knowing. For
instance, when Twitpic realised they could make money off their users'
pictures, they [changed the copyright
license](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13372982) to make a deal
with media agency WENN.

When [Instagram](http://tosdr.org/#instagram) was bought by Facebook,
they only had a limited copyright license that was neither transferable
nor sublicensable. At this stage, although Facebook had bought the
company Instagram for \$1 billion, Facebook could not really benefit
from the rights over users' photos. Guess what. When Instagram changed
their terms in January this year, they aligned their copyright license
to Facebook's (among [other
issues](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/12/19/instagram_privacy_everyone_s_ignoring_the_real_problems_with_its_terms_of.html)).

Before January 19, 2013, this is what Instagram wrote about copyright in
their terms:

> Proprietary Rights in Content on Instagram
>
> 1.  Instagram does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files,
>     images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship,
>     applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content")
>     that you post on or through the Instagram Services. By displaying
>     or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Instagram
>     Services, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully
>     paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify,
>     delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce
>     and translate such Content, including without limitation
>     distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through
>     any media channels, except Content not shared publicly ("private")
>     will not be distributed outside the Instagram Services.

After January 19, 2013:

> Rights
>
> 1.  Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on
>     or through the Service. Instead, *you hereby grant to Instagram a
>     non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free,* **transferable,
>     sub-licensable,** *worldwide license to use the Content that you
>     post on or through the Service,* subject to the Service's Privacy
>     Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/,
>     including but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your
>     Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your
>     Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your
>     Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the
>     Privacy Policy.

Facebook's current terms:

> 2.  Sharing Your Content and Information
>
> You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and
> you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application
> settings. In addition:
>
> 1.  For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like
>     photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the
>     following permission, subject to your privacy and application
>     settings: *you grant us a non-exclusive,* **transferable,
>     sub-licensable,** *royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP
>     content that you post on or in connection with Facebook* (IP
>     License).\* This IP License ends when you delete your IP content
>     or your account unless your content has been shared with others,
>     and they have not deleted it.

(Do not hesitate to have a look back at Facebook's [previous copyright
licenses](http://consumerist.com/2009/02/15/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever/))

But, this is necessary for them, right?
---------------------------------------

I have seen some arguments stating that these copyright licenses are
“boilerplate” (implying they're everywhere), and that they're really
necessary for them to provide you with the features of the service.

But this is not true. First, these copyright licenses are far from
standard because there are some vast differences even between similar
services. You can see that there are a wide variety of licenses with
huge differences that we have
[scrutinized](http://tosdr.org/topics.html#copyright-scope).

For instance, the copyright license you grant to
[YouTube](http://tosdr.org/#youtube) bears no explicit limitation,
whereas [Vimeo](http://tosdr.org/#vimeo)'s copyright license is
explicitly limited to 4 purposes. In addition, the copyright license you
grant to Vimeo is neither transferable nor sublicensable, as opposed to
YouTube.

To take another example, you can compare the copyright license that
[Twitter](http://tosdr.org/#twitter) requires with the license for
[Identi.ca](http://tosdr.org/#identi-ca) or
[SeenThis](http://tosdr.org/#seenthis). In case this isn't significant
enough, you can also compare Twitter's current copyright license with
the copyright license they had [before
2009](https://twitter.com/tos/previous).

Secondly, if it were really necessary for these services to have such
broad copyright licenses, I still see no clear reason why they would ask
for the possibility to *transfer* or to *sublicense* them.

And even if it was a matter of necessity, services could just state it
clearly and expressly in the copyright licenses. For instance,
[SoundCloud](http://tosdr.org/#soundcloud) asks for a copyright license
like this:

> **To the extent it is necessary** in order for SoundCloud to provide
> you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any
> of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to enable your use
> of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences to SoundCloud on a
> **limited**, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid
> basis.

Which terms of service are fair?
--------------------------------

Do not get fooled. Some businesses *do* get broad rights on your
published content when you “accept” their terms of service. Your content
is valuable, you should not blindly accept copyright licenses over them.

Here at ToS;DR, we *systematically* check the copyright licenses carried
in terms of service to find broad language. If you want to avoid giving
away your rights, one simple first step can be to
